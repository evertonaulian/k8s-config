helm:
  # Use a custom location for the Helm chart. This can refer to any go-getter URL.
  # This allows one to download charts from most any location.  Also know that
  # go-getter URL supports adding a digest to validate the download. If repo
  # is set below this field is the name of the chart to lookup
  # chart: ./chart
  chart: https://github.com/rancher/charts/blob/release-v2.6.3-patch1/assets/longhorn/longhorn-100.1.1%2Bup1.2.3.tgz
  # A https URL to a Helm repo to download the chart from. It's typically easier
  # to just use `chart` field and refer to a tgz file.  If repo is used the
  # value of `chart` will be used as the chart name to lookup in the Helm repository.
  # repo: https://charts.rancher.io
  # A custom release name to deploy the chart as. If not specified a release name
  # will be generated.
  # releaseName: logging

  # The version of the chart or semver constraint of the chart to find. If a constraint
  # is specified it is evaluated each time git changes.
